# Custom Web Experience with Amazon Q Business

| :zap: If you created a new Amazon Q Business application on or after April 30th, 2024, you can now set up a custom UI using the updated instructions provided below.
|-----------------------------------------|

**Note:** The instructions provided in this guide are specific to Cognito, but they should also work for other OIDC 2.0 compliant Identity Providers (IdPs) with minor adjustments.

Customers often want the ability to integrate custom functionalities into the Amazon Q user interface, such as handling feedback, using corporate colors and templates, custom login, and reducing context switching by integrating the user interface into a single platform. The code repo will show how to integrate a custom UI on Amazon Q using Amazon Cognito for user authentication and Amazon Q SDK to invoke chatbot application programmatically, through [chat_sync API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/qbusiness/client/chat_sync.html).

üë®‚Äçüíª The workflow includes the following steps:
1.	First the user accesses the chatbot application, which is hosted behind an Application Load Balancer.

2.	The user is prompted to log with Cognito

3.  The UI application exchanges the token from Cognito with an IAM Identity Center token with the scope for Amazon Q

4.  The UI applications assumes an IAM role and retrieve an AWS Session from Secure Token Service (STS), augmented with the IAM Identity Center token to interact with Amazon Q
    * Detail flow of token exchange between IAM Identity Center and Idp is explained in below blog posts

    üîó [Blog 1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/how-to-develop-a-user-facing-data-application-with-iam-identity-center-and-s3-access-grants/)

    üîó [Blog 2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/how-to-develop-a-user-facing-data-application-with-iam-identity-center-and-s3-access-grants-part-2/)


5.	Amazon Q uses the ChatSync API to carry out the conversation. Thanks to the identity-aware session, Amazon Q knows which user it is interacting with.
	
    *  The request uses the following mandatory parameters. 

        1.	**applicationId**: The identifier of the Amazon Q application linked to the Amazon	 Q conversation.
      
        2.	**userMessage**: An end user message in a conversation.
      
    * Amazon Q returns the response as a JSON object (detailed in the  [Amazon Q documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/qbusiness/client/chat_sync.html)) and below are the few core attributes from the response payload.
      1.	**systemMessage**: An AI-generated message in a conversation
    
      2.	**sourceAttributions**: The source documents used to generate the conversation response .In the RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) this always refer to one or more documents from enterprise knowledge bases which are indexed in Amazon Q.



## Deploy this solution


### Prerequisites: 
Before you deploy this solution, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- A valid AWS account.
- An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in the account that has sufficient permissions to create the necessary resources.   
If you have administrator access to the account, no action is necessary.
- An SSL certificate created and imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).   
For more details, [refer to Importing a certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate-api-cli.html).   
If you do not have a public SSL certificate, follow the steps in the next section to learn how to generate a private certificate.
- An existing, working Amazon Q application 
- IAM Identity Center, and create few users in Identity Center by configuring their email address and name

### Generate Private certificate

If you already have an SSL certificate, you can skip this section.   
However, if you don't have one and want to proceed with running this demo, you can generate a private certificate associated with a domain using the following openssl command:
```
openssl req \
  -x509 -nodes -days 365 -sha256 \
  -subj '/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland/CN=sampleexample.com' \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://cert.pem --private-key fileb://key.pem
```

‚û°Ô∏è Please note that you will receive a warning from your browser when accessing the UI if you did not provide a custom SSL certificate when launching the AWS CloudFormation Stack. The above instructions show you how to create a self-signed certificate, which can be used as a backup, but this is certainly not recommended for production use cases.  

You should obtain an SSL Certificate that has been validated by a certificate authority, import it into AWS Certificate Manager, and reference it when launching the AWS CloudFormation Stack.  

If you wish to continue with the self-signed certificate (for development purposes), you should be able to proceed past the browser warning page. With Chrome, you will see a "Your connection is not private" error message (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID), but by clicking on "Advanced," you should then see a link to proceed.


### üöÄ Deploy this Solution: 

Step 1: Launch the following AWS CloudFormation template to deploy ELB , Cognito User pool , including the EC2 instance to host the webapp.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

‚öôÔ∏è Provide the following parameters for stack

‚Ä¢	**Stack name** ‚Äì The name of the CloudFormation stack (for example, AmazonQ-UI-Demo)

‚Ä¢	**AuthName** ‚Äì A globally unique name to assign to the Amazon Cognito user pool. Please ensure that your domain name does not include any reserved words, such as cognito, aws, or amazon.

‚Ä¢	**CertificateARN** ‚Äì The CertificateARN generated from the previous step

‚Ä¢	**IdcApplicationArn** ‚Äì Identity Center customer application ARN , keep it blank on first run as we need to create the cognito user pool as part of this stack to create [IAM Identity Center application with a trusted token issuer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/using-apps-with-trusted-token-issuer.html)

‚Ä¢	**PublicSubnetIds** ‚Äì The IDs of the public subnets that can be used to deploy the EC2 instance and the Application Load Balancer. Please select at least 2 public subnets

‚Ä¢	**QApplicationId** ‚Äì The existing application ID of Amazon Q

‚Ä¢	**VPCId** ‚Äì The ID of the existing VPC that can be used to deploy the demo

üîó Once the stack is complete , copy the following Key from the Output tab .
------------------------------------------------

**Audience** : Audience to setup customer application in Identity Center

**RoleArn** : ARN of the IAM role required to setup token exchange in Identity Center

**TrustedIssuerUrl** : Endpoint of the trusted issuer to setup Identity Center

**URL** : The Load balancer URL to access the streamlit app


Step 2: Create an IAM Identity Center Application 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Navigate to AWS IAM Identity Center, and add a new custom managed application.

  **Select application type** -> then select OAuth2.0 -> Next

  If you can't find the option of creating a new custom managed application, please [Enable Organizations with IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.html).

- Provide an application name and description and select the below option as shown in the  image

  <img src="docs/iamdic_2.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>


- Now create a trusted token issuer 

  <img src="docs/iamidc_3.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

- In the Issuer URL  -> provide the ***TrustedIssuerUrl*** from Step 1,provide an issuer name and keep the map attributes as Email

  <img src="docs/iamidc_4.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>


- Then navigate back to IAM Identity Center application authentication settings , select the trusted token issuer created in the previous step[refresh it if you don't see in the list] and add the Aud claim -> provide the ***Audience*** from step 1 , then click Next

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_11.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

- In Specify application credentials ,  Enter IAM roles -> provide ***RoleArn*** from Step 1

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_5.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

- Then Review all the steps and create the application.

- Once the application is created, go to the application and -> Assigned users and groups .

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_10.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

- Then set up the Trusted application for identity propagation , follow the below steps to Amazon Q as Trusted applications for identity propagation

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_6.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_7.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

  <img src="docs/iamidcapp_8.png" alt="IAM IDC application" width="600"/>

Step 4: Once the IAM Identity Center application is created, copy the Application ARN and navigate to Cloudformation to update the previously created Stack. Enter the Identity Center Application ARN in parameter ***IdcApplicationArn*** and run the stack.

  <img src="docs/cfn_update.png" alt="CloudFormation update stack" width="600"/>

Step 5 : Once the update is complete, navigate to Cloudformation output tab to copy the URL and open the URL in a browser

Step 6 : Streamlit app will prompt to **Connect with Cognito**, For the first login attempt try to Sign up, use the same email id and password for the user that is already exist in IAM Identity Center.


‚ö° To eliminate the need for provisioning users in both the Cognito User Pool and the Identity Center, you can follow the link below to create a second custom app (SAML) in the Identity Center. This custom app will act as the Identity Provider for the Cognito User Pool.
